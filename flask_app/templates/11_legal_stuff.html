                    Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information
                    except where required or permitted by law. Providing us with your Personal Information is always
                    your choice. However, your decision not to provide certain information may limit our ability to
                    provide you with our products or services. We will not require you to consent to the collection,

                    Personal Information may only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected unless
                    you have otherwise consented, or when it is required or permitted by law. Personal Information will
                    only be retained for the period of time required to fulfill the purpose for which we collected it or
                    as may be required by law.

                    6. Accuracy
                    <br>

                    Personal Information will be protected by security safeguards that are appropriate to the
                    sensitivity level of the information. We take all reasonable precautions to protect your Personal
                    Information from any loss or unauthorized use, access or disclosure.
                    <br>

                    Upon request, you will be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of your Personal
                    Information, and will be given access to it. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your
                    Personal Information, and may request that it be amended, if appropriate. However, in certain
                    circumstances permitted by law, we will not disclose certain information to you. For example, we may
                    not disclose information relating to you if other individuals are referenced or if there are legal,
                    security or commercial proprietary restrictions.
